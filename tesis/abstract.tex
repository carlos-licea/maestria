In this thesis different methods to quantify body rigidity are presented, specifically local rigidity for lattices and proteins. Some algorithms are presented that can predict rigidity solely with the description of the present edges, Two of them are implemented: the PG and VPG algorithms. Their assumptions, methods and, concepts that make them up. Later, running times are also characterized and compared for different lattices and intrinsic characteristics.
